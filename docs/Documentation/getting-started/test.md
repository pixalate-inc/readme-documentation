#### **Pixalate Disclaimer â€“ Products**

Invalid traffic, viewability, and other designations that may be present in applicable Pixalate products and materials, including Pixalate Analytics, Pre-Bid Blocking Lists, and Media Rating Terminal, reflect Pixalateâ€™s opinions with respect to factors that Pixalate believes may be useful to our clients. While grounded in Pixalateâ€™s proprietary technology and analytics (which Pixalate evaluates and updates continuously), these designations are merely Pixalateâ€™s opinions (i.e., neither facts nor guarantees).

As used in the applicable Pixalate products and materials, and:

(i) per the [MRC Viewable Ad Impression Guidelines](http://www.mediaratingcouncil.org/063014%20Viewable%20Ad%20Impression%20Guideline_Final.pdf), the term "Fraud" is not intended to represent fraud as defined in various laws, statutes and ordinances or as conventionally used in U.S. Court or other legal proceedings, but rather a custom definition strictly for advertising measurement purposes;

(ii) per the [MRC IVT Addendum](http://mediaratingcouncil.org/101515_IVT%20Addendum%20FINAL%20\(Version%201.0\).pdf), "Invalid Traffic" is defined generally as traffic that does not meet certain ad serving quality or completeness criteria or otherwise does not represent legitimate ad traffic that should be included in measurement counts. Among the reasons why ad traffic may be deemed invalid is it is a result of non-human traffic (spiders, bots, etc.), or activity designed to produce fraudulent traffic.
